# ==============================================
# EXPERIMENT 3 – COLLABORATIVE CODING WITH GIT
# Forking, Cloning, PRs, Conflicts, Patch Files
# ==============================================

# STEP 1: Fork the repository on GitHub (UI Step)
# → Go to original repo → Click "Fork" → Create fork under your account

# STEP 2: Clone the forked repository into your local system
git clone https://github.com/karunya-0/forkedrepo.git
# Downloads entire repository into local folder

# STEP 3: Move inside the project directory
cd forkedrepo

# STEP 4: Check the current branch
git branch
# Usually 'main' or 'master'

# STEP 5: Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature-update
# Creates and switches to new development branch

# STEP 6: Make changes to any file (example: updating README.md)
# After editing, add changes:
git add README.md          # Stages modified file

# STEP 7: Commit your changes
git commit -m "Updated README with new details"
# Stores the change as a commit

# STEP 8: Push the feature branch to your remote fork
git push origin feature-update
# Makes branch available on GitHub for pull request

# STEP 9: Create Pull Request (UI Step)
# Go to GitHub → Your repo → "Compare & Pull Request"
# Write description → Submit PR

# STEP 10: Simulate a conflict
# (Make change in same file/line in both main & feature branch)

# Example:
# MAIN BRANCH LINE:   title = "Project Version 1"
# FEATURE BRANCH:     title = "Updated Project Title"

# STEP 11: Pull latest changes from remote main branch
git checkout main          # Switch to main branch
git pull origin main       # Get latest main updates

# STEP 12: Switch to feature branch for merging
git checkout feature-update

# STEP 13: Try merging main → feature branch to generate conflict
git merge main

# If conflict occurs, Git shows:
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md

# STEP 14: Open conflicted file to resolve manually
# Lines appear like:
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# (your change)
# =======
# (main branch change)
# >>>>>>> main

# Edit → Keep correct version → Save file

# STEP 15: Mark conflict resolved
git add README.md

# STEP 16: Commit after resolving conflict
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in README.md"

# STEP 17: Push resolved branch again
git push origin feature-update
# PR automatically updates

# STEP 18: Create a patch file for your changes
git format-patch -1 HEAD
# Creates patch file like: 0001-Resolved-merge-conflict.patch

# OR create patch for multiple commits:
git format-patch origin/main --stdout > update.patch
# Sends all commits since main into one patch file

# STEP 19: Apply a patch (on another system or project)
# Copy patch and run:
git apply update.patch
# Applies changes from patch into working directory

# STEP 20: Final PR merging (UI Step)
# Reviewer merges PR into original repository

# END OF EXPERIMENT 3
